## Bar Mitzvah

Thank you for joining us on this joyous Shabbat as Broden accepts the responsibility of his Jewish heritage as a Bar Mitzvah (son of the commandments).

Becoming a Bar Mitzvah means that Broden is now responsible for his actions, both ritual and ethical, and today he publicly accepts this responsibility in front of his family and friends.

Broden's participation affirms his adult status within the Jewish community; he is now able to fulfill commandments and assume religious responsibilities.

## Shabbat Service

-   Shabbat service begins at 9:30 and will conclude around 12:00 PM. It consists of multiple parts:

-   Shacharit, the introductory morning service

-   Torah Service

-   Musaf and Concluding Prayers

-   Kiddush, the blessing of wine and food before

-   After the Kiddush prayers, we invite you to join us for lunch at the synagogue.
